# RTX Neural Shading

RTX Neural Shading (RTXNS) also known as RTX Neural Shaders, is intended as a starting point for developers interested in bringing Machine Learning (ML) to their graphics applications. It provides a number of examples to help the reader understand how to train their own neural networks and then use those models to perform inference alongside their normal graphics rendering. 

RTXNS uses the [Slang](https://shader-slang.com) shading language and it utilizes either the DirectX Preview Agility SDK or the Vulkan Cooperative Vectors extension to provide access to the GPUs ML acceleration.

A number of examples are included which build upon each other from a simple inference example to more complex examples showing how to train a neural network to represent a shader or a texture. Helper functions to facilitate building your own neural networks are also included. 

Alongside the core samples is a SlangPy sample to demonstrate how to use python and SlangPy for fast iteration and development of neural networks which can then be integrated into RTXNS for inference. 

When exploring RTXNS, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with ML and neural networks.
